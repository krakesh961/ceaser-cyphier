Caesar Cipher 🔐

A simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the oldest and most famous encryption techniques.
This program allows you to encrypt and decrypt text messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet.

✨ Features

Encrypt messages with a custom shift.

Decrypt encrypted messages back to plain text.

Handles shifts larger than 26 by using modulo operation.

Simple and beginner-friendly Python code.

🛠️ How It Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the input text by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.
Example with shift = 3:

Plain Text:  hello
Cipher Text: khoor

💡 Future Improvements

Add support for symbols, spaces, and numbers.

GUI-based Caesar Cipher application.

Add tests for automated validation.
